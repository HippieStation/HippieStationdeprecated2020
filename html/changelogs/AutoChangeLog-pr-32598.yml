changes: 
  - refactor: "Cult population scaling no longer operates on arbitrary breakpoints. Each additional player between the between the breakpoints will add to the \"chance\" that an additional cultist will spawn."
  - tweak: "On average you will see less roundstart cultists in lowpop and more roundstart cultists in highpop."

# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Hey, Central here. We've found some older uniforms for security. We've put them in their respective lockers, since they're taking up valuable space here in our warehouse."
  - tweak: "New borg sprites have been resized for balance."
  - rscadd: "Ever since the clown got his licence revoked for wreckless driving, he's not had a fast way around the station. That changes now. Unicycle now spawns in his locker, which is extremely fast but neigh uncontrollable."
  - tweak: "Nerf gun now costs ten TC due to it's long ass stun."
  - rscdel: "My shitty snowflake self insert thingy has been removed from the loot table. Eat shit, Kiwi. It does spawn around, but you'll have to actively hunt for it."

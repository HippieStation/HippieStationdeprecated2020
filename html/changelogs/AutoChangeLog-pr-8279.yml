  - tweak: "Charlie/Delta Station (the \"old cryogenics pod\" ghost role) has been improved. Survivors can now finish the singularity engine and will have more minerals available inside the Hivebot mothership. The local atmos network is connected to an air tank; fire alarms and a bathroom have been added. Keep an eye out for a defibrillator too."

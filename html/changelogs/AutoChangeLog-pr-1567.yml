To solve this, we decided to just dump them all from orbit onto the barren lava planet. Unfortunately, the creatures called \"Legion\" have infested a great number of them, and you can now commonly find the bodies of former Nanotrasen employees left behind. Additionally, there are reports of natives, other settlers, and even stranger things found among the corpses."

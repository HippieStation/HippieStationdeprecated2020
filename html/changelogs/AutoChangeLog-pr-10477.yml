  - rscadd: "Assimilation has received an update!"
  - rscdel: "Mindshield Implants and other hivemind host identifying methods no longer reveal their name."
  - rscadd: "Now, both parties will be able to sense the other's location for a short period of time, similar to a pinpointer."
  - balance: "In the case of Network Invasion, the probing host still only gets information on the vessel they just lost and not the opposing host."
  - balance: "As a hivemind host becomes stronger and starts going on the offensive, they become easier to sense, and their own sensing ability is diminished."
  - balance: "In addition, using Mind Control renders you unable to sense others at all."

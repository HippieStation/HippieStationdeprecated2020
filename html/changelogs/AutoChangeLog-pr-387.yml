changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a patrol path for bots, includes 2 round-start securitrons placed on opposite sites of station."
  - wip: "Due to map size, mulebots are still somewhat unreliable on longer distances. Disposals are still advised, but mule bots are now technically an option for delivery."
  - rscadd: "Added multiple status displays, extinguishers, and appropriate newscasters to hallways."
  - rscadd: "A drone dispenser is now located underneath Engineering in maintenance."
  - rscadd: "Each security checkpoint now has a disposal chute that directs to a waiting cell in the Brig for rapid processing of criminals. Why run half-way across the station with some petty thief when you can just shove him in the criminal chute and have the warden deal with him?"
  - tweak: "Security's mail chute no longer leads into the armory. This was probably not the best idea in hindsight."
  - tweak: "Virology has a bathroom now."
  - tweak: "Genetics monkey pen is a bit more green now."
  - bugfix: "Lawyer now has access the brig cells so he can complain more effectively."
  - bugfix: "Xenobio kill chamber is now in range of a camera."
  - bugfix: "Removed rogue bits of Vault area."
  - bugfix: "Medbay escape pod no longer juts out far enough to block the disposal's path."
  - bugfix: "Captain's spare ID is now real and not just a gold ID card."

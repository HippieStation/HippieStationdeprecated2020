				<li class="rscadd">Added programmable nanites to science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Science now has a nanite chamber, a nanite program hub, a nanite cloud console and a nanite programmer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">From the program hub you can download nanite programs (unlocked through techwebs) to disks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can then customize their functionality and signal codes through the Nanite Programmer.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The nanite cloud console controls remote program storage; it stores program backups that nanites can be synced to through cloud IDs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nanite programs range can be either helpful or harmful; their main potential is that they can be enabled at will through the use of remotes and sensors. The potential uses are endless!</li>

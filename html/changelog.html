				<li class="rscdel">Viruses can no longer be made invisible to the Pandemic</li>
				<li class="tweak">Symptoms no longer trigger with a 5% chance every second, but instead have a minimum and maximum number of seconds between each activation, making them more consistent.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The symptoms Blood Vomit and Projectile Vomit have been removed, and are now bonuses for the base Vomit symptom.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The Weakness symptom has been removed as it was completely useless.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Sensory Destruction symptom has been reworked into Narcolepsy, which causes drowsiness and sleep.</li>

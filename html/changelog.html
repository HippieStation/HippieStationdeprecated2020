				<li class="tweak">Air contents inside a tank react additionally once instead of thrice when exploding</li>
				<li class="balance">Humans now have a punch damage range of 1-10, up from 0-9</li>

				<li class="balance">The stun duration for a critical punch now scales with how much stamina/brute damage the victim has</li>
				<li class="balance">Punches now deal full stamina damage + half damage in brute (effectively 1.5x damage on all punches, not accounting for stamina regeneration)</li>
				<li class="balance">Kicking (punching a prone person) does full brute damage, never misses, and does 1.5x damage</li>
				<li class="balance">Grabs are now harder to break out of the more stamina/brute damage you have</li>
				<li class="balance">Failing to resist out of a grab will deal a bit of stamina damage to you</li>
				<li class="balance">In all instances above where both stamina and brute damage are considered, brute is weighed 1/2 as heavily as stamina (meaning stamina has more of an effect than brute when it comes to punch-stun duration, miss chance, etc)</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="balance">Null Rod skins are back to their old (fun) selves, fixing what could be perceived as bugs (not being able to wear fedora etc) in the process. The Null Rod no longer possesses antimagic capabilities. Rather, antimagic has become an inherent gene in chaplains. The downside: No more sweaty captains dumpstering wizards by having a rod on their belt. The upside: Chappy is FUCKING INVINCIBLE to sorcerer tomfoolery, even if they drop their null rod.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Dark Blessing has had a visual touch-up to Pious Gold from Changeling Red. This will theoretically result in fewer screeching bald men from toolboxing innocent chaplains to death.</li>

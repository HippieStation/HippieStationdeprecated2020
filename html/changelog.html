				<li class="bugfix">dead livers no longer runtime</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">14 September 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">ATH1909 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Changed the default name of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder to "mundane powder" (from "crayon powder"), to better reflect that it can't color anything (its subtypes still can, of course) and that /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder isn't found in most crayons anymore.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the names of the subtypes of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder so that they no longer mention crayons/"crayon powder".</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changes the wordings of the descriptions of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder and its subtypes to be less weird (and to mention that invisible powder and mundane powder can't color anything). This change should also make the description of mundane powder no longer state that it can color things the "none" color.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ATHATH updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="balance">Omega weed has lost its haloperidol, capsaicin, barber's aid, itching powder, and histamine chemical production traits. In exchange, it's received the nicotine production trait as an additional chemical production trait. The chemical production traits that were in omega weed before this change but were not mentioned in the above list are still in omega weed.</li>
				<li class="balance">The list of chemical production traits of rainbow weed has been changed from 15% mindbreaker toxin and 35% lipolicide to 5% colorful reagent, 3% psicodine, 10% happiness, 10% mindbreaker toxin, and 15% lipolicide. This should make ingesting rainbow weed change your character's color, but should also make 100 potency rainbow weed highly addictive.</li>
				<li class="balance">The extradimensional orange has received the 15% haloperidol chemical production trait that omega weed used to have.</li>
				<li class="balance">The base damage dealt (before modifiers) by stepping on a d4 without shoes on is now 1d4 damage (dropped from just a flat 4 damage).</li>

				<li class="balance">Earthsblood's healing has been changed; its burn and brute healing rates have been increased, but its oxygen, stamina and clone healing rates have been lowered.</li>
				<li class="balance">Earthsblood heals you less before its 26th cycle in you, but also deals less brain damage to you before its 26th cycle in you as well.</li>
				<li class="balance">Earthsblood now gives you the pacifism trait temporarily while it is in your system.</li>
				<li class="balance">If you are a human, the earthsblood overdose effect now, in addition to its previous effects, gives you a pacifism brain trauma with a resilience of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. If you already had a pacifism brain trauma with a resilience of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_BASIC (for some reason), it will increase the resilience of that brain trauma to TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. This pacifism brain trauma is NOT taken away when the earthsblood chem leaves your system.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The confusion symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now actually affects how much the symptom increases your confused value by (instead of affecting the cap that the symptom can bring it to, which is plenty high enough by default).</li>
				<li class="tweak">The dizziness symptom now actually makes you noticeably dizzy (and has a cap for how dizzy it can make you).</li>
				<li class="tweak">The dizziness symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now makes your screen look "druggy" all of the time (only once its virus reaches a high enough stage, of course), instead of only occasionally.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The hallucigen symptom's stealth 4 threshold effect now continues to give you positive messages instead of bad ones at stage 5. Before this tweak, meeting that stealth threshold would actually cause bad messages to appear MORE often at stage 5 than if you hadn't met it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pretty much completely reworked the narcolepsy symptom so that it now uses the "drowsyness" (yes, that's how it's spelled in the code; no, I don't know why it's misspelled like that in the code) status effect instead of a confusing mess of ticking counters that rarely actually put you to sleep.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The narcolepsy symptom's transmission 7 threshold effect now only requires transmission 4 no longer causes its virus to occasionally deal negligible amounts of stamina damage. Instead, it now causes the host to periodically yawn, spreading its virus whenever they do so.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The narcolepsy symptom's resistance 10 threshold effect is now a stage speed 10 threshold effect.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The narcolepsy symptom's activation frequencies have been tweaked a bit to make the symptom less threatening (albeit still quite potent) without its stage speed 10 (formerly a resistance 10) threshold effect.</li>
				<li class="balance">The nacrolepsy symptom now adds 0 to its virus's transmission stat (upped from -4).</li>

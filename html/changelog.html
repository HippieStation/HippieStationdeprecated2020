			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New UI system for cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment. Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ritual Dagger, replacing the Arcane Tome. This is largely a thematic alteration but its to reinforce that your primary tool is also a weapon.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cyborgs and AI are finally unable to see runes again</li>
				<li class="tweak">Only the cult master can forge Bastard swords now, regular cultists can get a mirror shield.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The mirror shield, it blocks, it reflects, it creates illusions, and an incredible throwing weapon! The mirror shield also bears a unique weakness: Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly shatter it and briefly stun the holder.</li>
				<li class="balance">Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune. The user will now choose which effect when invoking.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit realm.</li>
				<li class="balance">The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists, and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there in the future.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">No more EMP rune.</li>
				<li class="balance">The conceal/reveal spell now has 10 charges and will conceal far more, including cult structures and flooring.</li>
				<li class="balance">The stun spell will now stun for ~4 less seconds and silence for 2 more seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">The EMP spell now costs 10 health to use, up from 5, and has had its heavy/light EMP range nerfed by 1 and 2 respectively (now 3 and 6).</li>
				<li class="balance">The shackles spell now has a silence effect similar to the stun talisman.</li>
				<li class="balance">The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment", which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.</li>
				<li class="balance">The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities of blood for unique and powerful relics.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All cult structures now generate significantly less light.</li>
				<li class="balance">Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood than before.</li>
				<li class="balance">Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Unholy water will now splash victims properly.</li>
				<li class="balance">Unholy Water Vials created at altars now contains 50 units, and is better at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.</li>
				<li class="balance">Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown. Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount of HP (200 from 250).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and a 35s cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down from 5.</li>
				<li class="balance">It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert cultists via holy water.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).</li>
				<li class="balance">Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Assmilation has received a major update! remove: Kill, Maroon and Protect objectives have been removed from the mode.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five vessels. This gives hosts more power from the get-go and gives them distinct phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The psychic link pinpointer now starts off with very little time for hosts and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected via NI, they can be tracked for an extra 30 seconds, and every successful use of NI increases the duration of all tracking by 10 seconds. A successful use of a new power, Reclaim, also increases the duration of all tracking by 30 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that without generous use of Network Invasion and Reclaim, hivemind hosts will lose their radar before Security does.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Four new powers have been added!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reclaim is an early-game ability that instantly kills critically injured hosts that are adjacent, and reduces all power requirements by five vessels for each host reclaimed, instantly unlocking your next set of powers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Psychoreception is an early-game ability that gives you the approximate distance of anybody currently tracking you and any hosts you've previously detected via Network Invasion.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chaos Induction is a mid-game power with a single use that turns four random vessels into antagonists with a single, customizable objective.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to sleep for up to almost a minute. The more people affected, the less time it lasts, the minimum being eight seconds. remove: Mass Assimilation has been removed as Reclaim now fills its role.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Assimilate Vessel and Release Vessel's cooldown have been reduced to 5 seconds to reduce waiting time between assimilation attempts.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bruteforce is no longer temporary, but immobilizes the user for five seconds after assimilation.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hive Sight also lets you hear what the vessel does.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The antag limit has been upped from 6 to 9</li>
				<li class="code_imp">A lot of internal changes to how Assimilation works. In summary, Assimilation now affects the mind instead of the mob, meaning that players will stay assimilated in a few more scenarios, most notably after death.</li>
				<li class="balance">Induce Panic and Distortion Field have been buffed to be more reliable, especially at lower hive sizes.</li>
				<li class="balance">Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect hivemind hosts. experimental: A new endgame has been added. The One Mind that survives this ordeal will show the world the true terror of the word Hivemind.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed several bugs involving hivemind tracking, team assignation and de-assimilation not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Assimilated vessels lose their vessel status when cloned once again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made several hivemind abilities less janky.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The sprite for members of the One Mind has been updated to be much more noticeable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Assimilation has received an update!</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Mindshield Implants and other hivemind host identifying methods no longer reveal their name.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Now, both parties will be able to sense the other's location for a short period of time, similar to a pinpointer.</li>
				<li class="balance">In the case of Network Invasion, the probing host still only gets information on the vessel they just lost and not the opposing host.</li>
				<li class="balance">As a hivemind host becomes stronger and starts going on the offensive, they become easier to sense, and their own sensing ability is diminished.</li>
				<li class="balance">In addition, using Mind Control renders you unable to sense others at all.</li>

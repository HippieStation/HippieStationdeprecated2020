	Because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a buncha criminal scum sucking faggots, I'm there to 1) Survive the fucking round. \
	2) Guard the armory. So you can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee I will continue to use \
	the shotgun to apprehend criminals. Because it's quick, clean and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around \
	with the disabler shots, which take half a clip just to bring someone down, or with the tazer bolts which are slow as balls, \
	impossible to aim and do about next to jack shit, fuck all. The shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon. Because it stops crime. \
	And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals roaming the fucking halls."

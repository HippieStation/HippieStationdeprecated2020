        "I'm thinking we should roll out a git repository for our research under the AGPLv3 license so that we can share it among the other stations freely.",
        "I dunno about you guys, but IDs and PDAs being separate is clunky as fuck. Maybe we should merge them into a chip in our arms? That way they can't be stolen easily.",

flying 
a room full of soft, moist eye-balls
your family's childhood spaceship 
a college buddy 
your hands falling off and spurting blood everywhere 
a huge cave full of leeches
rockets blasting off
rain made of your own tears
the hidden places where I should go, and I knew that I went to before they even told me
a crazy god laughing hysterically
a team of men trying to blow up the station
a 4'7 bearded drunk individual

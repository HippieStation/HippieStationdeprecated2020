[Title]: # Your feature needs to have a good title. If you want an object added, the object's name would be a good title, and such. Use common sense.

[Implementation]: # How should the feature work out? What exactly is it supposed to do, in your initial idea? If an item, can it be crafted/found/bought and for what?

[Why]: # How does your feature improve the game anyhow? Why should it be added?

[Resources]: # Eventual assets such as icons and sounds which you have and want to suggest related to this feature.

# Be sure to ask some maintainer to label this issue as a feature. Either ping them on our discord or PM them on our forum. Thank you for sharing your ideas!

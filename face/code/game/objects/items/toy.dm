You can make a tray shield with some tape and a tray and a lack of dignity, and it'll stop lasers in their tracks however!" , "YORE DED FREEMAN!", "I USED TO PLAY COLLEGE BALL, Y'KNOW.", "HELLO MY NAME IS MARIE ALAIRE HURR", "Hey, that's pretty good.", "CAT BOIS REPRESENT", " I'M FUCKING INVINCABLE!", "RIGHT ARM RULE! Wait... FUCK!", "LEFT ARM RULE!", "Lorentz force! GO!", "Pro tip, the energy bailsong and stealth implant as a traitor is horrendessly broken. If you want to eliminate your target easy mode, that's the way to do it.", "The world calls for wetwork! And we answer!", " OH YEAH, AND FROM THIS DAY FORWARD WE WILL REMEBER THE DAY OF THE RED SUN! THE DAY WHEN MANKIND GAVE WAR A CHANCE!!", " Pro tip, throwing acid on your face will mask your identity. This will make security HUDS, beepsky and all that unable to detect you as your face resembles my nightmares rather then an actual face.", "Pro tip, Spears have a crazy high embed chance, and embed chances ignore armor. Got a HOS with a fuckton of riot shields and riot armor? Just throw the shit at him.", "I can stand being around you!", "Theres nothing wrong with a good ol dick once in awhile.", "Pro tip, the cake hat at bar, when ignited does ten damage, leaves no fingerprints and is silent, and leaves no blood either. Perfect for killing someone neatly. Also, goes on your head!", "SELF ESTEEM TEAM! GOOOOOOO!! MEEOOOOW!", "ASHES TO ASHES, MOTHERFUCKER!!!", "Protip. During Nuke ops, make a water potassium grenade in chemistry, and set it with an igniter and mouse trap. Put both nuke disk and this grenade in the box in your backpack, and the next person to open the box will fucking explode, and it'll teleport the nuke disk away! That'll slow down the syndicate!", "And if you see Doctor Breen, Tell him I said, Fuck you!", " WE ARE ALL PAWNS. CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING GREATER! MEMES, THE DNA OF THE SOUL!", "Protip. Cisterns in toilets. You can use a crowbar to put stuff in them, and NOBODY checks them. NOBODY.", "Pro tip. Butts of holding are a gimmick item and useless, but tag team it with a bluespace body bag of holding, and you've got a huge ammount of storage. I'd recommend putting a firesuit/spacesuit up there, as you can escape perma or survive space quickly. Or just shove the entirety of the armory up your butt.", "Pro tip, you can inject cigarretes with stuff. People won't usually take them off you, so you can fill it full of omnizine and atropine and come back from crit. Or fill it with plasma and leave it in the bar, and watch the fireworks go off from a distance.", "hmm yes", "Protip. Flashes are powerful. Only security and heads of staff will usually have protection, and they stun for a good while.", "DEHUMANIZE YOURSELF AND FACE TO BLOODSHED", "Toy soldiers Unite!", "Doctor Steel, Doctor Steel!", "Aw shit, this is just like Doom!", "Holy shit, this shotgun is straight outta doom.", "Jet fuel can't melt steel memes", "Rwalls are pretty hard to break down, but 50 units of thermite will break through them via space, or twenty units in atmosphere will do it! Or you can just be an asshole and throw CLF3 at it. That'll just eat it straight up.", "Protip: Admins will usually let things slide if it's funny. Setting up a saw style obsticle course in the hallway? Priceless.", "Protip, don't do the same thing every round. Rushing the fire axe every round is ample time for someone to figure out what you usually do and use that against you.", "Protip, nobody usually checks your ass. If you combo shoving a lighter up there with a fire extinguisher, you can make yourself the human torch.", "SON OF A BITCH!", "Hey, you ever wonder why we're here?", "Come in, Blue Command. This is Blood Gulch Outpost Alpha. Do you read me?", "Protip. There is NEVER a good roundstart captain. You're usually better off breaking into shit yourself.", "Hey, maybe we should hold hands.", "For a brick, he flew pretty good!", "Doctor Pavel? I'm CIA.", "Dear humanity. We regret being alien bastards. We regret coming to Earth. And we most definitely regret the Corps just blew up our raggedy-ass fleet!", "ODST Heading Downtown.", "Helljumpers are in the tubes.", "MAC, Firing.", "Target Locked; Firing Main cannon.", "Here comes the Maxium Overdrive!", "Grizzly, Awaiting orders!", "This is ground control to Major tom, Can you hear me, Major tom?", "Young Girl, They called them the Diamond Dogs!", "Do you know exactly what your family would do if an attack came? Say at, Ten oclock tommorow morning.", "Spirit to Forge, get your men up here this instant!", "The unenlighted masses! They cannot make the judgement call!", "Protip. Working with a head of staff to set up power will usually net you in their good books, and they'll probably give  you all access if you can proof yourself worthy.", "Pro tip. Science will LOVE you if you can get materials, And they usually don't care how they get it. You can find a bluespace crystal in the medical surgery observatory, There's silver in the silver coins and the surgery tables, and you can get gold from coins or the vault.", "People seem to be allergic to just about everything. And we have to sleep. That takes up far too much of my time. And we have to eat, and poop. Humanity: The pinnacle of evolution? NO! A work in progress! We're still in the prototype phase. We're still working out all the bugs.", "Fulton recovery confirmed onboard helicopter.", "You're going to extract HIM?", "He didn't fly so good!", "I won't spread your sorrow to the heartless sea. I will always be with you.", "I am the EDGIEST PERSON THIS SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE." , "Protip, you can make a improvised shotgun with some wood, a pipe fitting and duct tape. It holds one shell of any ammo type, and the best of all, can be sawn off to fit in your backpack. If you work with science, you can easily get pulse slugs, and cause havok.", "TAKE OFF EVERY 'ZIG'!!", "you will all taste oblivion! Which tastes just like Red Bull... which is disgusting!", "SORRY, FOLKS! THE OLD PROGRAM'S BEEN CANCELED! BUT WE'VE GOT A FINALE THAT'LL DRIVE YOU WILD! REAL ACTION! REAL DRAMA! REAL BLOODSHED! ON OUR NEW SHOW ... ATTACK OF THE KILLER MEMES!", "I swear someone keeps fucking with the sights on these when I'm not looking.", "Californnnaa, Rest in peaaaaaaaaaace.", "Shit man I LOVE me some snowflake code lemme tell ya.", "[user] us toys... See EVERYTHING.", "It's a pleasure to be in your Iron grip, Boss!", "Pro tip, [user.ckey] You can go to the the tech storage, and hack into the secure area for AI upload consoles and Robotics control consoles. That'll deal with that pesky army!", "Protip. Reagent forge is absolutely insane. Learn how to use it. You can print off deplated uranium ammo that goes through so many walls, Synthflesh maces that heal and never run out, it's kinda bonkers.", "Pro tip, you can find soap at medical, Brig, Captains office or with a bit of gibs, make your own!","Forge is down.", "Forge is back up.", "What is a meme but a misrable pile of secrets.", "Don't even think about using autofire or I'll know.", "It's time to split!", "Memes? Where we're going, we don't need memes.", "If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.", "Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?", "Is this a fucking flash game?", "Why don't you play a GOOD game? Like uh. System shock 2. Bam. Stop playing this... Internet explorer game? Jesus christ, Dude.", "Protip. Pneumatic cannons can be built, and can fire anythings. Sure, you could use it to fire food at people, or fill it with hatchets and anything remotely sharp to get a terrfying one hit kill machine.", "HOLLYWOOD TAKE ME TO THE TOP I SWEAR I'LL NEEEVER LET YOU DOOOWN", "Stay Fresh!", "INTERGALATIC, PLANETARY INTERGALATIIIC.", "Did you buy my new album on audiable? You should. It's good. Think like, The Beastie boys meet Doctor Steel. Actually no that sounds fucking terrible.", "GRAND DAD!?", "FLENTSTONES?", "HET", "A E S T H E T I C S", "I'm nuclear, I'm wild. I'm breaking up, INSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE", "Y O U  U N D E R S T A N D  I T ' S  A L L  I N  Y O U R  H E A D", "Get the cool! Get the cool shoeshine!", "I'm happy, I'm feeling glad, I've got sunshine, in a bag.", "Witty comment.", "Ironic inside joke.", "Metagame.", "WE ARE CONNECTED, WE'LL NEVER BE ALONEEE.","So apparently you can implant any being. You could put a macrobomb in Ian to make him a bomb that will mostly likely go off, you could inject Pete with a chemical implant to make him into a slip grenade. The possibilities are endless!", "Hey. Do you ever wonder why we're here?", "god i'm so fucking annoying", "Gamer Tip: The Singlo EMPs shit. You can use that to your advantage to get the captains closet open without damaging it, or make a defib into a stunbaton that gives people heart attacks.", "If you make uranium or gold bullets in the forge, they go through walls. A lot of walls. Uranium is also great against mechs, as while the bullet won't hurt them, the radiation will leak into the cockpit. Good luck healing that, dick nips.")
